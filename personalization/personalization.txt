Choice point #1: COLOR THEME
B
I chose the personal palette with 3 to 5 colors that I felt went well together. 
I picked a dark teal kind of color, that was accompanied with a lighter teal.
Of course, I used accents colors like black and white. 
These colors work well together because they are all just different hues of eachother. 

NEXT QUARTER PLANNING
My classes for next quarter:
A block- English Hon
B block- College Psychology 2
C block- AP European history
D block- SAT prep

Explanation:
- Why did you choose these classes?
These classes are hard but they all sound interesting to me.
- What are you most looking forward to learning?
I am really excited to learn about the French Revolution in AP Euro history, and about general thoughts and feelings for pyschology. 
- Which class do you think will be most challenging and why?
I have heard that AP Euro is the hardest class I will be taking next semester, granted it hasn't started yet I already have homework. 
- If you have a free period, how do you plan to use it productively?
I have an off block whenever I am not in class for Pyschology, I will do homework for that class but also for my other classes.
- How will these classes help you reach your academic or career goals?
SAT prep will ensure that I get a good SAT score on the test therefore, allowing me to go to the college I want to. 

REFLECTION 
What I learned:
- What Bootstrap concepts made sense to you?
The two different concepts of jumbotron-fluid and container made sense. It explained the different sectioned off places and whether they fill the space or not.
- What was most challenging?
The Bootstrap allignment classes were quite difficult and I still don't really understand them.
- How do you feel about your CSS customization?

- What would you add to JagTrack in the future?
- How will you use this site for planning next quarter?

I like the month one because it gives me a good perspective of the entire month and due dates.
