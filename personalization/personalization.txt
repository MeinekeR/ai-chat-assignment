Choice point #1: COLOR THEME
B
I chose the personal palette with 3 to 5 colors that I felt went well together. 
I picked a dark teal kind of color, that was accompanied with a lighter teal.
Of course, I used accents colors like black and white. 
These colors work well together because they are all just different hues of eachother. 

NEXT QUARTER PLANNING
My classes for next quarter:
A block- English Hon
B block- College Psychology 2
C block- AP European history
D block- SAT prep

Explanation:
- Why did you choose these classes?
These classes are hard but they all sound interesting to me.
- What are you most looking forward to learning?
I am really excited to learn about the French Revolution in AP Euro history, and about general thoughts and feelings for pyschology. 
- Which class do you think will be most challenging and why?
I have heard that AP Euro is the hardest class I will be taking next semester, granted it hasn't started yet I already have homework. 
- If you have a free period, how do you plan to use it productively?
I have an off block whenever I am not in class for Pyschology, I will do homework for that class but also for my other classes.
- How will these classes help you reach your academic or career goals?
SAT prep will ensure that I get a good SAT score on the test therefore, allowing me to go to the college I want to. 

REFLECTION 
What I learned:
- What Bootstrap concepts made sense to you?
The two different concepts of jumbotron-fluid and container made sense. It explained the different sectioned off places and whether they fill the space or not.
- What was most challenging?
The Bootstrap allignment classes were quite difficult and I still don't really understand them.
- How do you feel about your CSS customization?
I really enjoy my CSS customization, I like the different colors, and the organization of everything.
- What would you add to JagTrack in the future?
I think different color themes would be cool. As well as other tabs and things when it is made for smaller screens and stuff.
- How will you use this site for planning next quarter?
With the updated links and organizational features it will be easy to use this site to make sure I am on top of my work and not falling behind.

Hours spent: 2 weeks of class



















Calendar Setup:
- Did you create a new calendar or use an existing one? I just embedded the one from Canvas.
- How many Canvas iCal feeds did you add? 3
- Did you add them individually by course or as one combined feed? One combined


Reflection:
Write 4-5 sentences about the calendar integration:
- How will this calendar help you stay organized?
It will visually organize everything.
- What challenges did you face getting it set up?
I couldn'[t figure out how to toggle between different calendar set ups.
- Did you customize the calendar appearance? How?
Yes, I had it show the month, the week, and the schedule set ups. 
- What view works best for you (month, week, agenda)?
I like the month one because it gives me a good perspective of the entire month and due dates.
- What other calendars might you add in the future?]
I could add a personal one, a school one, and a cheer schedule. 



Color Scheme Design:
[Write 5-7 sentences about your color choices:
- What colors did you choose for light mode? Why?
For both the light and the dark mode I used the same colors, just turned their usages around. So I used, white, light teal, dark teal, and gray.
- What colors did you choose for dark mode? Why?
Similar to the light mode, I used dark teal, light teal, gray, and white.
- How do your color choices reflect your personality or style?
One of my favorite colors is blue and another one of my favorite colors is green and green and blue mixed is teal.
- Did you use any color theory principles (complementary, analogous, etc.)?
I used monochrome, I used the same color but just different hues and values of that color. 
- How did you ensure good contrast for accessibility?
I made sure that if there was a dark background the words were light and vice versa. 
- What tools did you use to help choose colors?
I used the gradient color picker in the css styles that just pops up when picking colors. 
- Were there any colors you tried that didn't work? Why not?]
Yeah, I attempted to use both green and blue separately, not mixed and I did not like the way it looked. 


Theme Preferences:
- Which theme do you prefer personally and why? 
I think I like the light mode better just because I like how lighter backgrounds look with the colored text.
- When do you think dark mode is most useful? 
When you are in a dark room, or when it is dark outside I think it's much better to have a dark mode. 
- Did you create any custom CSS for the toggle button?
Yeah, I like when I hover over it, it pops up with a gray kinda circle around it. 


JavaScript Understanding:
[Write 4-5 sentences showing you understand the JavaScript code:
- In your own words, what does the JavaScript do?
The Javascript is what makes the button switch the light mode to the dark mode, and when you switch tabs to Next Quarter it keeps it in dark mode. 
- What is localStorage and why is it useful?
It is for persisting user preferences, and data persistence, it toggles the dark and light modes.
- What happens when you click the theme toggle button?
It changes the theme from dark mode to light mode and the other way around. 
- Why does the theme preference persist when you reload the page?
Because of Javascript and localStorage usages within the entire webpage.
- How might you use JavaScript in future projects?]
If I want another toggle button for dark or light theme or just two different themes, and to make sure those themes carry on to other tabs.
